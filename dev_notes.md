### DISCLAIMER
- I use Gridsome for sketching
- It won't be Gridsome after I finish the sketch
- It will be Nuxt
- No, it likely won't be not Nuxt
- Vue has 2 major concepts you need to grasp: components and reactivity.
Catch up on that, and you'll be understanding the code easily
- Node is performant enough, we will apply aggressive Nginx caching to it
to ensure that even more
- SSR is rendering as much HTML on the server as possible and sending
ready to display HTML to the client instead of JS creating it client-side
- Hydration is constructing vDOM from ready-to-display server-
or statically rendered HTML
- vDOM is a representation of DOM created by Vue to batch DOM changes for
performance reason
